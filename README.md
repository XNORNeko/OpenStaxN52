This project is fully open source! Please use it for your own projects, share it, and try new ideas. I want to push the development of the N52 as a platform for everyone, and open accessibility to anyone interested. 

Please note that this project was more of a "Proof Of Concept" than a full release, there will be fitment and design issues. I have not tested the project on a car/engine, and am too busy to do such for quite a while.
I am a 3rd year Mechanical Engineering student, so much of this project was more vibe based than anything- The whole project was 5hr from start to finish.

I have linked the base solidworks file, a .stl, and an N52 base flange. You can use all of these to create your own velocity stacks, manifold, etc. Enjoy!

Note: This is my first time using Github, sorry for terrible structure!
